All files contain very simple and easy to read code and it is DRY. 
Design and style meets all conventions, just some minor warnings from PEP8. 
Logic is easy to understand and it is clear what the code is doing.
Nice job adding comments, it was very helpful to follow.
Instructions on how to install and use module are very helpfull.

What to improve: 
Would be nice to add doc strings to your classes to get info on what parameters it takes.

In general you done a great job! 3 stars!
